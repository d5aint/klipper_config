# LDO Voron-2.4r2

This is my actual config folder for my Voron v2.4 printer.

Please mind this is a WIP and the config files are being updated very frequently depending on the mods I add to the machine or just if I want to. **Do not** take it 
as a fully compliant config : think and adapt to your own machine.

I also try to put all possible setting and customizations in the Klipper config as my ultimate goal would be to use the same Gcode file (sliced generically) with 
multiple materials or even share it across multiple printers. That's why I'm using firmware retraction, and I set Pressure Advance, etc... in my config.
